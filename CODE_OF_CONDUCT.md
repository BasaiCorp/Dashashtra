# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., a physical or electronic address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **basaicorp06@gmail.com** or through our [official Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SJ9bDV5vPg). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. Further details of enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

# Daily Rewards System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Function Name Mismatch**: 
   - The client code was calling `userCoins.getCoins()` but the actual function in the module is `userCoins.getUserCoins()`
   - Fixed all function calls to use the correct function name

2. **API Route Configuration**: 
   - The route in `earn.js` was defined as `/api/earn/daily` but the router was mounted at the root level
   - Fixed by changing the route to `/daily` to match the client-side fetch URL

3. **Session Handling**: 
   - Added enhanced error handling and validation of the session
   - Added proper session checks for authentication in the daily reward endpoint
   - Updated session properties access to match what's actually available in the session object

4. **Client-Side Feedback**: 
   - Added visual feedback when claiming rewards
   - Added a more robust notification system
   - Improved error handling and display on the client side

5. **Debugging and Logging**: 
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the daily reward process
   - Created a test button and debug output area to help troubleshoot issues
   - Added detailed logs to diagnose problems with the `addCoins` function

6. **Balance Update Handling**: 
   - Created a centralized function `updateAllBalanceDisplays()` to ensure all balance displays are updated consistently
   - Added appropriate delay before page reload to ensure all updates are saved

7. **Request Headers**: 
   - Added `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to help prevent CSRF issues
   - Added better cache busting with timestamps

## Testing

Created a stand-alone test script (`test-coins.js`) to verify the functionality of the user_coins module independently of the web interface. The test confirmed that the core coin functions are working correctly:

- `getUserCoins()`: Correctly retrieves a user's coin balance
- `addCoins()`: Successfully adds coins to a user's balance
- `removeCoins()`: Successfully removes coins from a user's balance
- `hasEnoughCoins()`: Correctly checks if a user has enough coins

## Additional Enhancements

1. Added better visual styling for the test interface
2. Improved notification system with different types (success, error, warning, info)
3. Added detailed session logging to help debug authentication issues
4. Enhanced error handling with more descriptive messages
5. Improved the UI for the daily reward button status
